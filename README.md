# SmartThings-PoolControl
Using the Particle Photon to control/monitor pump, valves, lights, and eventually, pH, ORP, acid dispense and freeze protection and allow control from SmartThings. Built upon bscuderi13's original code. I am adding the use of Rosemount industrial pressure and temperature instruments, utilizing an ncd.io 4-20 mA current loop receiver board to bring in the data through I2C while leaving pleny of IO available on the Photon itself for other features I may add to the pool later. Atlas Scientific sensors are candidates for pH and ORP. Conductivity may be used to determine water hardness by the presence of dissolved metal ions.
